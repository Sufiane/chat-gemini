# Chat Gemini
1 prompt 2 AI

### The idea
TL;DR: Ask one time, get twice the answer

With one prompt, you'll get the answer of the two (most used?) AI's: Gemini (google) & ChatGPT (openAI).

### How it works

- You ask a question
- We ask both AI's
- You get one answer

### Set up
Currently, you need to add your API keys in the .env file.
Simply copy `env.example` into `.env` and edit it.

:warning: openAI currently do not offer a free plan :warning:

### Future development

- user account
- manage api key for each AI (at least openAI)
- Add more AI's
- allow user to select which AI to use
- allow user to select which model to use
